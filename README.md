# OOAD Graduate Presentation
TEAM MEMBERS:

1.	SANDESH DHAWASKAR SATHYANARAYANA
2.	HASIL SHARMA


## DESCRIPTION:
The project Presentation has mainly three important files in src/ directory that are important for our demo. All the classes has been provided with a `main` static method for running.

1.	`class_demo`: This java package has class examples program that explains how the reflection API's are used for Class and objects.

  * `reflection_class.java`: This class should be run to understand the API of class and objects in reflection Java.

2.	 `array_enumerations`: This Java package has classes that explains the second lesson of our presentation i.e. using the reflection to the arrays and enumerations in Java.     
  * `array_enumeration.java`: This class explains the program that shows how to use array and enumerations along with reflection features in Java
3.	`members`: This package has several sub classes and each of them explains the usage and demo example of using the reflection in Fields, Member and constructors in Java
  * `Field_get_set_demo.java`: Explains the reflection Fields API’s in Java
	* `field_getmodifiers.java`: Explains the reflection Fields API’s in Java
	* `fields_gettype.java`: Explains the reflection Fields API’s in Java
 	* `method_getmodifiers.java`: Explains the reflection Method API’s in Java
  *	`method_invoke.java`: Explains the reflection Method API’s in Java
  *	`method_type.java` Explains the reflection Method API’s in Java
  *	`constructor_getconstructors.java`: Explains the reflection Constructors API’s in Java

For running in-class demo simply execute the class `TheClass` in your IDE. This shows the usage of annotations in java which uses Reflections under the hood to achieve dynamic behavior.
## USAGE:
This program will be used to demonstrate the each lessons of Reflection in our presentation and same could be used to learn the concepts of reflections in Java.
