DESCRIPTION:
The Current Project is developed in the Java Eclipse IDE and hence the project should be downloaded to IDE and run simply by clicking the run button on the top of IDE for each of the below .java files/class files. The project Presentation has mainly three important files in src/ directory that are important for our demo.
1.	class_demo: This java package has class examples program that explains how the reflection API's are used for Class and objects.
a.	reflection_class.java: This class should be run to understand the API of class and objects in reflection Java.
2.	 array_enumerations: This Java package has classes that explains the second lesson of our presentation i.e. using the reflection to the arrays and enumerations in Java
a.	array_enumeration.java: This class explains the program that shows how to use array and enumerations along with reflection features in Java
3.	members: This package has several sub classes and each of them explains the usage and demo example of using the reflection in Fields, Member and constructors in Java
a.	Field_get_set_demo.java: Explains the reflection Fields API’s in Java
b.	field_getmodifiers.java: Explains the reflection Fields API’s in Java
c.	fields_gettype.java: Explains the reflection Fields API’s in Java
d.	method_getmodifiers.java: Explains the reflection Method API’s in Java
e.	method_invoke.java: Explains the reflection Method API’s in Java
f.	method_type.java Explains the reflection Method API’s in Java
g.	constructor_getconstrucots.java: Explains the reflection Constructors API’s in Java


USAGE:
This program will be used to demonstrate the each lessons of Reflection in our presentation and same could be used to learn the concepts of reflections in Java.
